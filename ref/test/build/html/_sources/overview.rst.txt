This project is non-profit, and belongs to any adult citizen who wishes to participate in it.

The project belongs to this part - identifed by himself as ``astroo-``, all his messages are signed with a PGP containing the signature ``${NOT_PROVIDED_YET}``. This is done as to provide at least good software for use by future administrations. The intention is to eventually make the project fully decentralized and then find the first state administration in one of the world's States. 

Future voluntary administrations, will be composed of citizens of the local state. Doctors, engineers and technicians. Each world state will have its own portal, which will respect the official local laws of the State, provided that there is the possibility of its existence in conjunction with the main guidelines of this project.

The purpose of the project is divided into two parts:
–  Provide current and recent serious information. In the possible attainment of wisdom on a personal level, through a system of topics. Unbiased information provided freely which will contribute to the development of everyone worldwide. This information is composed of credible page sources through shortcuts, with the exception of complete articles of the project itself, of the day itself or recent, chosen by professional specialists in the field concerned, being volunteers.
– Providing a means as to allow specialized people to join by using rooms and topics related to the information. This rooms will be supervised by volunteer specialists, for the proper functioning, it is possible to participate or aid, as professionals in various areas ( Similar to telegram and IRC, but with a super bot, and only working in the presence of experts).

The operation is very well thought out. For now, volunteer programmers are doing at least some programming. All programming is free and publicly exposed, except for internal security, that only a few people will have access to, as a hypothesis. And then given to future administrations.
When the project matures, it may be possible to be a system of application for the new Human and Citizen Rights.
I’m the inventor and project manager, and I apologize for being anonymous, because I’m anti-fame and I like privacy. Besides, not being alone, and only one person in more than 7000 with I talk to, almost all wishing the project, to work in practice.
